        <p>Our kitchen is lucid, light and dynamic. Our mission is to create meals that involve all our senses - restores, challenges and enriches.</p> <br>
        <p>"Dynamic means force and stands for the living formative forces of nature. These forces are not visible, but their biologic "footprints" are. The effects can be seen if one learns to observe and understand the connections between the formative forces and the physical matter of all organisms".</p>
